 - Make sure to turn your volume on for the full experience with sound effects.

- The Space Shuttle Scheduler utilizes Firebase, which will allow the user to input information regarding new shuttles, while creating a schedule.

- The "Append Space Shuttle" user input fields are, "Space Shuttle Name," "Destination," "Initial Space Shuttle Landing," and "Frequency."

- Once the user submits the information by clicking the "Launch" button, the information will display under the, "Space Shuttle Schedule."

- There are five columns of information that will display for each space shuttle, "Space Shuttle Name," "Destination," "Frequency," "Next Arrival," and "Light Years Away."

- The  "Append Space Shuttle" input fields allow the user to create as many space shuttle schedules as they choose, which will all display in the "Space Shuttle Schedule" as described.

 Sound effects begin to play when the user clicks the "launch" button.
